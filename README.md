# Endfield Tool — Production Calculator for “Arknights: Endfield”

[中文](./README_zh.md)

## Project Overview

Endfield Tool is a production planning and facility calculation tool for **Arknights: Endfield**.  
It helps players plan and optimize resource production: building facilities, crafting items, managing recipes, and calculating required raw materials and production time.

## Main Features
- One-click view of items and recipes: browse craftable items in the game along with their input/output recipes and production times.
- Production targets and planning: add target outputs (target item and quantity); the tool will automatically expand the required recipe chain and calculate total raw material needs.
- Facility and capacity estimation: shows required facility types and recommended counts to help you schedule construction and allocate resources.
- Real-time interaction: adjust target quantities, switch recipes or facilities, and the page will instantly recalculate and display results.
- Multi-language support: the interface includes localized text for Chinese, English, etc. (implemented via the project's internal i18n).
